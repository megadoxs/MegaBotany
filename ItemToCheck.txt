Don't work the way I want them to or would like them to

RingOfCurse
RingOfManaDrive
MasterBandOfMana
ElvenKingRing // only works with botania bauble
SuperCrown

Need new textures

RingOfWallClimb
RingOfWallJump
RingOfParkour
RingOfParkour2

flowers will need balancing, day & night < Bell < Hydro < Tinkle < Reikar
BloodyEnchantress should be more like a Gourmaryllis
I don't like Edelweiss generating mana from snowman kills
bell flower texture and name are highly likely to change
remove chunk loading from stardust and manalink
optimise their use of the getBlock() & isValid() methods

do I give achilled shield second's form from extrabotany?? change name also.

Shield need some fixing on how the player see it being used
infinite splash and absolution pendant are temporary names
holy hand grenade, infinite splash and absolution pendant have not textures
