Don't work the way I want them to or would like them to

MasterBandOfMana
ElvenKingRing // only works with botania bauble

Need new textures

RingOfWallClimb
RingOfWallJump
RingOfJump

flowers will need balancing, day & night < Bell < Hydro < Tinkle < Reikar
BloodyEnchantress should be more like a Gourmaryllis
I don't like Edelweiss generating mana from snowman kills
bell flower texture and name are highly likely to change
remove chunk loading from stardust and manalink
optimise their use of the getBlock() & isValid() methods

Shield need some fixing on how the player see it being used
absolution pendant are temporary names
absolution pendant have not textures
